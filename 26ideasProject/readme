Project Description

Create a web application that:

    Allows a person to sign in using Google authentication
    Let’s a user enter information about their friends and their birthday. For example, upon signing in, I can specify my friend’s name, friend’s email address and the date of birth. I can do it for as many friends as I want.
    I should also be able to upload a csv file with three columns (name, email, date of birth). This way, I can batch upload a list of friends with their birthday.
    I should get an email reminder about a friend’s birthday 24-48 hours in advance.
    I should be able to search for a friend’s entry by entering the friends name or email address.
    Deploy it on AWS using their free tier. Use docker image for your code. Collect all logs and send them to papertrail service (use free tier).
